# ðŸ’œ For Mia â€” On Your Birthday

The world was quieter before you arrived.  
The sky held its breath, waiting for a spark â€”  
and then you were born, and everything began to bloom.  

You are not just a person,  
you are a language I never knew I spoke,  
a heartbeat that hums through everything I love.  

Your laughter â€” itâ€™s sunlight caught in motion,  
warm and soft, the kind that lingers even when the day ends.  

You draw on your hands, like your skin is a canvas  
and your thoughts need a home.  
And somehow, even in the smallest gesture,  
you create something infinite.  

Loving you feels like watching the ocean breathe â€”  
endless, alive, never the same twice.  

Youâ€™ve taught me that love doesnâ€™t need to shout to be strong.  
It can whisper.  
It can hum.  
It can simply exist, like air and light â€” everywhere, always.  

You are the calm between storms,  
the dream that stays when I wake,  
the quiet proof that some souls were meant to meet.  

So on your day â€” I celebrate you.  
The girl who finds poetry in silence.  
The artist who turns moments into miracles.  
The love who made my world gentler, brighter, and endlessly new.  

**Happy birthday, my beautiful Mia. ðŸ’œ**
