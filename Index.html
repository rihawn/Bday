  My world, quieter, but you arrived.<br>
  The sky held its breath,<br>
  everything began to bloom.<br><br>

  You are not just a person,<br>
  You are <b>my person.</b><br>
  You are a language I never knew I could ever speak,<br>
  a heartbeat that hums<br>
  through everything I love.<br><br>

  Your laughter â€”<br>
  Just like sunlight,<br>
  warm and soft,<br>
  the kind that lingers.<br>
  Your art â€”<br>
  a secret between your soul and the world,<br>
  color and silence<br>
  Made into something only you could make.<br><br>

  You draw on your hands,<br>
  like your skin is a canvas.<br>
  Your thoughts need a home.<br>
  And somehow,<br>
  even in the smallest gesture,<br>
  you create something infinite.<br><br>

  Loving you feels like<br>
  watching the ocean â€”<br>
  endless, alive,<br>
  never the same.<br>
  Youâ€™ve taught me that love<br>
  doesnâ€™t need me to shout to be strong.<br>
  It can whisper.<br>
  It can hum.<br>
  It can simply exist,<br>
  always.<br><br>

  You are the calm between storms,<br>
  the dream that stays when I wake,<br>
  the quiet proof that some souls<br>
  were meant to meet.<br><br>

  So on your day â€”<br>
  I celebrate you.<br>
  Your existence.<br>
  The artist who turns moments<br>
  into miracles.<br>
  The love who made my world<br>
  gentler,<br>
  brighter,<br>
  and endlessly new.<br><br>

  <b>Happy birthday, my beautiful Mia.</b><br>
  The world is softer because youâ€™re in it â€”<br>
  and I am, too.<br><br>
